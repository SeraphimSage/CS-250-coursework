## Agile Reflection Journal

1. How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?
   1. To interpret user needs there are several ways to go about this.
      1. In agile development teams working closely with the Product Owner, and they in turn with the client, are the first step towards defining the user stories that the rest of the team will use to build their software implementations off of. They will come together and help to define exactly how the development team can help solve the clients problem.
      2. In turn as the tester and developer are working on these user stories there may be times when what was what thought to be clear will need to be re-evaluated and brought to the product owner for clarification. This refinement can help flush out how specifically the client would like to see a specific aspect of the product come together and have an open diaologue through the product owner with the rest of the team.
      3. The tester also may have to think creatively as to how a potential customer will use a given application. This can help to make the application more intuitive and less likely that the customer will look elsewhere for a solution if they get frustrated trying to figure out how the application runs.
      4. Finally one of the last ways that a team may help with interpreting user needs into a program is that the product owner or scrum master may hold meetings with some of the potential customers and ask a series of questions posed from the development team. Not all of these requests may be feasible, but these can help to point out what users look for most when they are using an application or what their impressions are when they first see it.
   2. User stories through all of this are a concise and easily identifiable method that the team can use and test against to determine whether a given point that has been brought up either by the client or by customers has fully been addressed in the application and with the help of the tester clear pass/fail criteria are designed to help achieve this.
2. How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?
   1. My approach to developing programs is first to get a base established to build off of, and then to iterate on modular pieces at a time.
   2. This approach allows for unit tests to be conducted on small subsets of the total program in isolation so that testing can be optimized and errors can be quickly found and resolved with as little loss to velocity as possible.
   3. In the future I hope to become better and segmenting functions that make sense to be segmented so that the code remains "DRY," and simple with clear documentation. When working on a team communication is critical to any projects success. If I know how a piece of code works, but the rest of my team does not because of how I've implemented it. This can have an extremely detrimental effect on the projects opperations, the most brilliant solution can be useless if the rest of the team is not able to understand what is being said or done.
3. What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?
   1. To me being a good team member in software development means that I am open and honest with the rest of my team on possible blindspots that I have, and that I am willing to listen and learn from each member of the team. Even if I have years of experience there are always still areas that can be refined and expanded upon. Software development like many other areas of society is rapidly changing and advancing if I neglect learning new ways of opperating and performing tasks I am liable to be left behind as technology grows and progresses.
   2. Additionally being considerate of the rest of my teams needs and being open to helping them out when they are struggling.
