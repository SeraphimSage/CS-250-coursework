## Agile Reflection Journal

1. **How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?**
   1. To interpret user needs there are several ways to go about this.
      1. In agile development teams working closely with the Product Owner, and they in turn with the client, are the first step towards defining the user stories that the rest of the team will use to build their software implementations off of. They will come together and help to define exactly how the development team can help solve the clients problem.
      2. In turn as the tester and developer are working on these user stories there may be times when what was what thought to be clear will need to be re-evaluated and brought to the product owner for clarification. This refinement can help flush out how specifically the client would like to see a specific aspect of the product come together and have an open diaologue through the product owner with the rest of the team.
      3. The tester also may have to think creatively as to how a potential customer will use a given application. This can help to make the application more intuitive and less likely that the customer will look elsewhere for a solution if they get frustrated trying to figure out how the application runs.
      4. Finally one of the last ways that a team may help with interpreting user needs into a program is that the product owner or scrum master may hold meetings with some of the potential customers and ask a series of questions posed from the development team. Not all of these requests may be feasible, but these can help to point out what users look for most when they are using an application or what their impressions are when they first see it.
   2. User stories through all of this are a concise and easily identifiable method that the team can use and test against to determine whether a given point that has been brought up either by the client or by customers has fully been addressed in the application and with the help of the tester clear pass/fail criteria are designed to help achieve this.
2. **How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?**
   1. My approach to developing programs is first to get a base established to build off of, and then to iterate on modular pieces at a time.
   2. This approach allows for unit tests to be conducted on small subsets of the total program in isolation so that testing can be optimized and errors can be quickly found and resolved with as little loss to velocity as possible.
   3. In the future I hope to become better and segmenting functions that make sense to be segmented so that the code remains "DRY," and simple with clear documentation. When working on a team communication is critical to any projects success. If I know how a piece of code works, but the rest of my team does not because of how I've implemented it. This can have an extremely detrimental effect on the projects opperations, the most brilliant solution can be useless if the rest of the team is not able to understand what is being said or done.
3. **What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?**
   1. To me being a good team member in software development means that I am open and honest with the rest of my team on possible blindspots that I have, and that I am willing to listen and learn from each member of the team. Even if I have years of experience there are always still areas that can be refined and expanded upon. Software development like many other areas of society is rapidly changing and advancing if I neglect learning new ways of opperating and performing tasks I am liable to be left behind as technology grows and progresses.
   2. Additionally being considerate of the rest of my teams needs and being open to helping them out when they are struggling.

1. **Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?**
   1. In this project DriverPass was a fictional startup company provided to explore the topics of Systems Analysis and Design. In this project the development team's project manager was tasked with completing a series of steps prior to any designs being finalized that would lay the ground work for future development. These include a Gantt Chart for estimated timeline and completion of tasks, various UML Diagrams that laid out the working of the project at different levels of view, and business documentation stating how the project would take into account the clients needs and various aspects that would need to be taking into consideration such as functional, non-functional requirements for the project, security considerations, and what some possible best practices would be to complete the project on time, and within budget.
   2. The client was a startup team called DriverPass, this consisted of Liam the owner, and Ian DriverPass's IT professional. There was mention that there would be a secretary, and various driver's working for DriverPass, but not names were ever given to these, however steps were taken to account for instances of how they would need to use the system and what their specific roles would be.
   3. The client requested that an online learning system be developed that allowed customer users to practice taking driving tests online, and see their results, these would need to be automatically updated by information either made available or otherwise provided from the DMV. Customer users would also be able to schedule time within the system to have one of DriverPass's drivers pick them up for a driving lesson so the student could recieve in person driving instruction.
2. **What did you do particularly well?**
   1. With my background in business management, I felt most comfortable exploring the business aspects and constraints of this project.
3. **If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?**
   1. I would spend more time on the the diagrams that I completed and take a look at how each user would be interacting with the system, what their daily experience with the system would be and then would try to represent this in an appropriate way within the systems diagrams without overloading these with superfluous information.
4. **How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?**
   1. While working through this project I tried to look at them through their eyese and think of what they would need to accomplish during each day. I typically did this on a higher level though and only really accounted for the instances that were specifically described in the DriverPass interview document that was provided at the beginning of the term. I knew that DriverPass would want a clearn and well organized program, the customers would like to have an intuitive and fast loading platform that they felt was well and professionally made and didn't seem like it was just thrown together. IT would want to have a system that didn't need continous oversight, but would alert them if there were issues that needed to be addressed and allow them to go in and manually update something to the correct values if there was a mismatch in data somewhere.
   2. I feel it is important to consider the user's needs when designing because as we are working on designing or developing a system if we better fit the system to what the user truly needs then we help them accomplish their goals and provide more value to them. In turn we are seen in a better light and the next time they need a solution to a problem they are more likely to turn to our team again in the future.
5. **How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?**
   1. In designing software I try to start with a birds eye view and see what goal the client is trying to accomplish. From there I'll try to get a product that will meet the clients needs at a base level and begin iterating and adding additional functionality onto it. Along the way I'd like to recieve feedback if the client is happy with the direction the project is going and give input and have a conversation about how feasible what they are requesting is within the budget that they are talking about, and the timeline they would like it completed in.
   2. Something that I'd try to do more in the future is to be better about pausing and shifting my paradigm to what the client is seeing. I feel that by being on the same page as the client from the beginning or as close as possible it's much quicker and easier to have successful project both for the development team as well as for the client.
